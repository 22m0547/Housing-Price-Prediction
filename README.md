### House Price Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning regression algorithms. The goal is to enable accurate price estimation for real estate transactions by considering various features of the houses. This project aids both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions without prior knowledge of the exact house prices.

Key Features
Utilized a dataset with diverse features describing houses, including property type, location, amenities, and more.
Implemented well-known regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model performance.
Created a user-friendly interface to input house features and generate price predictions.
Demonstrated the power of machine learning in predicting house prices based on objective features.
code:
git clone https://github.com/22m0547/house-price-prediction.git

Usage
Follow the instructions in the script to input the features of the target house.
The script will utilize the trained regression models to predict the house price.
Benefits
Empowers buyers to estimate reasonable price ranges for potential houses.
Assists sellers in setting competitive and fair selling prices.
Reduces uncertainty and enhances transparency in real estate transactions.
Showcases the integration of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
Conclusion
The House Price Prediction project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the real estate domain. By predicting house prices based on property features, it equips both buyers and sellers with valuable insights for making confident decisions. The project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in the housing market and highlights the potential benefits for all stakeholders involved.
